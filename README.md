# Weather App
A web app that allows users to search for the current weather by city as well as a 5 day forecast.

## Technology Used
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)

## What I Learned
This was the first project I used event delegation on dynamically generated list elements.  It's also my first time using the ajaxStart and ajaxStop methods to show and hide a render screen.
